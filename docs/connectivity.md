# Connectivity in IoT

Connectivity is crucial for IoT devices to communicate and exchange data.

## Wireless Communication Technologies

- **Wi-Fi**: Common for home and office environments.
- **Bluetooth**: Used for short-range communication.
- **LoRaWAN**: Suitable for long-range, low-power applications.

## Wired Communication Technologies

- **Ethernet**: Reliable and high-speed connectivity.
- **Power Line Communication (PLC)**: Uses existing electrical wiring.

## Network Protocols

Protocols like MQTT, CoAP, and HTTP facilitate communication between IoT devices.
